# Stock-prediction
Machine Learning Project in python
In this project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. We will develop this project into two parts:
First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.
